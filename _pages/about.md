I am a Research Fellow at [Input Output (IOG)](https://iog.io/) and
an Associate Professor at the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/computer-science/research/groups/), Durham University, where I am a member of the [NESTiD](https://nestid.webspace.durham.ac.uk) and [ACiD](https://algorithmscomplexity.webspace.durham.ac.uk) groups. 

Before that, I was a lecturer (Assistant Professor) at the University of York and Queen's University Belfast. I also held postdoctoral research positions at the [Crypto Team](https://crypto.di.ens.fr/web2py), École Normale Supérieure (Paris), the [Cryptoplexity Group](https://www.cryptoplexity.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/), and TU Darmstadt (Germany).

I completed my PhD at the [Cryptography and Information Security Group](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/research/cryptography/), University of Bristol, and studied Mathematics to Part III at [Queens’ College](https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/), University of Cambridge.
