I will be moving to the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/computer-science/research/groups/) at Durham University as an Associate Professor from Jan 2022. I will be a member of the [NESTiD](https://nestid.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) group. Currently, I am an Assistant Professor (Lecturer) at the [University of York](https://www.york.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/courses/bsc-beng-computer-science/). 

Previously I held research positions at the [Crypto Team](https://crypto.di.ens.fr/web2py), École Normale Supérieure (Paris), the [Cryptoplexity Group](https://www.cryptoplexity.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/), TU Darmstadt (Germany), and the [Information Security Group](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/research/), Royal Holloway.
