I will be moving to the [CS Department](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/computer-science/research/groups/) at Durham University as an Associate Professor in Computer Science from Jan 2022, where I will be a member of the [NESTiD](https://nestid.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) group. 

Currently, I am an Assistant Professor (Lecturer) at the Department of Computer Science, University of York. 

Previously I held research positions at the [Crypto Team](https://crypto.di.ens.fr/web2py), École Normale Supérieure (Paris), the [Cryptoplexity Group](https://www.cryptoplexity.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/), TU Darmstadt (Germany), and the [Information Security Group](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/information-security/research/), Royal Holloway. 

I completed my PhD at the [Cryptography and Information Security Group](http://www.bris.ac.uk/engineering/research/cryptography/ ), University of Bristol, and studied Mathematics to Part III at [Queens’ College](https://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge.
