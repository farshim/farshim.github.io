I am interested in the rigorous development of cryptographic primitives, security models, and relationship between primitives. Recently, I have been working on idealized models of computation, such as the random-oracle or the ideal-cipher model, as well as cryptosystems with advanced functionalities, such as functional encryption, multilinear maps, and obfuscation. A list of my publications appears below; see also my DBLP and Google Scholar pages.
